3275,"My weight was frequently asked about when I was trying to get my depression medicated. They started talking about me being too fat to be allowed treatment.    My mother being asked if she thought my anxiety was just a personality trait.    Being told after the first medication I took for my depression hadn't worked and I was there to try another one that 'medication probably just isn't going to work for me' - he then gave me a very similar medication and told me if it didn't work at the lowest dose it wouldn't work at all so there would be no point increasing the dose and there would be no point trying any other treatment.    Being told my anxiety could just be the result of tachycardia, by the nurse that did my first ECG I had to get to get ADHD meds, despite her not being qualified to read the results of the ECG (which she admitted) or qualified on mental illness (she was only qualified to work the ECG machine) - telling me my anxiety didn't even exist, despite tachycardia not being a cause of anxiety but a symptom which the doctors and cardiologist confirmed.    My parents being asked if they wanted me to get the treatment I needed for my ADHD after months of me fighting for it and having done every barrier they could think of, despite me being 21 at the time and it being my appointment that the psychiatrist invited my parents to against my will.

She also kept touching me without consent despite this clearly making me uncomfortable.    Having to listen to the nurse who did a blood test on me against my will complain about her child with ADHD and tell my mother about how she is denying him medication because she found it inconvenient that it didn't work perfectly at the lowest dose of the first medication and her child started expressing his needs which she found inconvenient. She very clearly did not consider me to have bodily autonomy, she didn't think consent applied to me despite me being an adult at the time, which she was aware of.    Audiologist refusing to diagnose me, despite me having done the whole diagnostic process and clearly requiring diagnosis (which he admitted). Telling me and my parents that I shouldn't be using ear defenders, which allow me to access places outside my bedroom as they limit my pain, and referring me to an abusive therapy without my consent ignoring me explaining that this was not appropriate or required - this was also unrelated to why I was there.    Being told to get out of bed in the mornings and go outside and to exercise to cure my depression, despite me having told them that I do not have the energy to do this (that it is literally impossible for me to do) and that being outside triggers my sensory issues making me ill and in pain. Also trying to recommend 'diet' as a cure for depression, despite knowing nothing about my diet - they just wanted me to restrict my diet further.

This person also told my parents that in terms of severity I was probably like 'a two out of 10.' I've now been struggling with an eating disorder for nearly 25 years. That does not say 'two out of 10' to me.,Yes
4447,armchair evaluations rather than actual evaluations,No
4489,"That I'm too thin, & if I'd just gain weight, all my health problems would be fixed, including my 'Fibromyalgia' (he basically referred to it in quotations), without even doing an examination. They completely wrote me off. Then in the ER when I was getting fluids for severe dehydration, SVT, heart palpitations, syncopal episode - after coming in via ambulance, this nurse randomly told me that I look nowhere near malnourished & that I had no reason to be in the hospital. I've had nurses be basically hateful towards me when I refuse to be weighed when I KNOW the times when it's completely unnecessary, & they try to bully me into it. That's just a few. There have been many more, trust me. Weight stigma & bias goes both ways. They often refuse to run tests or even give me fluids when I know I need them, just because they think I look fine. I wear baggy clothes to hide my weight, so even when they don't ask, they just assume I look a 'normal weight.' And with my dermatillomania, they think I'm drug seeking JUST because I'm walking into the ER. Or because they can see I'm underweight, they make hateful comments that if I 'just eat' that I'll be fine, & that they have patients with 'real problems' who 'don't choose' to be sick. So yeah, it's just as painful. But hey, at least in the ER they don't cuss me out.",Yes

I had brought up the 'picky eating' with him for several years in a row at that point and wanted some assistance. I did not feel this was a helpful comment. It in no way helped me know what I needed to do to improve my daughter's ability to eat a variety of foods. This was the last time I took her to see him. I decided at that point to change both of my daughters to a new pediatrician. The new pediatrician has followed my daughter and is willing to discuss it during the appointments, but there are no treatment options other than suggestions at home. I do appreciate these, but I also feel my daughter would benefit from seeing a professional who specifically treats ARFID.",Yes

Only then did she sign off on her recommendation for me to go to treatment. I was 5'2', 109 pounds & she thought I was a 'good weight' for my height but I was dying telling her I wanted to go to treatment because I finally came to terms I had an eating disorder.

I made an appointment with a gynecologist to see if everything was ok or if i needed additional tests/care. the gyno then told me in front of a medical student and scribe that the reason i had pcos was BECAUSE i was overweight and that i could either lose the weight and be fine or take birth control to manage it (which i didn't want to do). she then explained how she was doing keto and intermittent fasting to control her weight and that I should consider trying both of those before our next visit. she didn't do any testing besides a diabetes and thyroid check, both of which came back normal.p",Yes

Then someone else came into my room to tell me they weren't letting me transfer, and I had a panic attack. They told me, 'Oh, poor princess, so upset you can't get everything you want' in a mocking tone.     Another example: I had a pneumothorax that got misdiagnosed by student health. They looked at my chart and noted I had mental health issues and immediately decided I must be having a panic attack. I told them that wasn't the issue, and they continued to probe about my mental health.

So he didn't think I could handle one. Even though I have been on one before. I've been told good job for losing weight. The last GI I saw left me with the medical advice to 'get fat'.

I've been called neurotic, I've been told I can't stop throwing up when it's one of the few symptoms I do NOT experience.

Therapists who spoke of their messed up romance situations, or childhood sexual abuse, neither of which applied to my circumstances.  I had a nurse case manager at UCLA advise that seeing a Registered Dietician was not part of the standard of outpatient care for bulimia.  She advised that those girls go off to what is akin to a day spa and ride horses and do art therapy.  She refused to authorize my PCP's request for me to see an RD, even after 3 attempts and multiple calls from my UCLA PCP, who was part of the same health system.       I had my UCLA OB-GYN disclose my bulimia in front of my husband, who was not aware, during one of my pre-natal exams, b/c I'd disclosed to him that I was struggling, and he failed to note what I had explicitly requested that he NOT do--bring that aspect of my care up in front of my future child's father.      Multiple PCPs have shied away from the topic of my bulimia, when presented as a concern I'd like to address during either my yearly exam, or in-between visit to get a referral to a specialist, etc.  They are unaware of treatment protocols, where to refer, who holds financial responsibility, and who should authorize the care, resulting in, at best, the aforementioned RD denial experience eventually producing a visit with an RD, 1.5 months after initially requested, and after pleading and crying on the phone w/ the UCLA RN case manager, out of frustration as a pregnant bulimic that desperately wanted help for fear of harming her 1st born child due to her own unsafe binging/purging practices.

After years of hiding cuts under sweaters in hot weather, I still have to hide scars under long sleeves in hot weather and it absolutely sucks. I constantly consider covering them with a tattoo but for work reasons, that's not really an option.   I've also had a therapist start crying and yelling at me that I just don't want to accept that people 'give a shit' about me. That was fun, since being yelled at is a huge trigger after growing up in an abusive home. I get she was frustrated, I know I was an incredibly frustrating, too-smart-for-my-own-good, argumentative and messed up patient for many years - I would have torn my hair out if I was my therapist too - but I really, desperately needed a therapist who could work with CPTSD, and it wasn't until I found one who did that I was able to heal from an entire childhood of trauma/cope with the array of diagnoses I was given from various providers, many of which I question the accuracy of/ and recover from a 15 year long ED. People with trauma need trauma therapists and good ones. Especially somatic therapists. And it should never be assumed that people with ED always have concerned and caring families who are ready to do family therapy with you. Family therapy is a joke when you have abuse and domestic violence in your family. (I'm sure it's great for people with caring parents but it shouldn't be assumed that everyone has them.)",No

I did not return to his office after my initial visit. This was before my eating disorder began, but it impacted me deeply.    I was given restrictive advice from a dietician after she told me she had worked with patients with restrictive eating disorders.

666,"I told multiple providers I was severely restricting food and over exercising and wanted help. I was told because of my BMI I did not have an issue and was encouraged to lose more weight to improve my health. I was having anxiety around food, panic attacks, making myself throw up, restricting everything for long periods of time and then binging on vacations when I wasn't dieting. I exercised hours every day and was getting dizzy spells and light headed often and having irregular periods. I have horrible pain with ovulation. I became covered in hives and my skin got red. I also after losing 60 pounds started gaining weight back so I restricted more. I went to many providers for help with these issues and specialists for dermatology and autoimmune and allergies.

I have very large breasts and had lots of pain and she told me I was too fat for a reduction and would need to live with the pain or stick to a diet after I told her how active I was and at the time doing whole 30 (for years) I saw a dermatologist for my hives and she told me my skin was bad because I was so fat and she didn't want to give me medication because of my size. I was 174lbs and 5'4 and told I needed to lose weight before she would help me with my skin. I saw an immunologist and she is the one that finally told me I had no allergies I am under a severe amount of stress and that is hurting my body. She also told me BMI is bullshit and I need to allow myself to eat food and get mental health support. I stopped restricting as best I could and tried to get a doctor to help but all the primary care doctors I saw told me to lose weight. Even when I told them I was restricting and over exercising I was told I was too fat for an eating disorder and that I should try keto. I eventually found a primary care doc who told me I needed mental health support for my stress and chronic pain and eating issues. He told me that any provider that only offers weight loss doesn't really know how to treat a patient and that my stress anxiety pain hives and panic attacks were not related to my body size.i then had to try to find a therapists and after 9 different therapists said they were not comfortable working with me based on my chronic pain and eating issues I finally found one.
